<h2>Service / Help</h2><br><br>

You as a customer is central to us. <br> <br>

To assist you as soon as possible, you can find all kinds of information here on the left (on mobile below). <br>
Perhaps the answer to your question already exists! <br>
If you can not find the answer to your question, or would you like custom advice, we would be happy to help. <br> <br>

For a reply by mail, you can easily leave a message via the <a href="index.php?content=contact"style="color:black;"> contact form. </a> <br>
Usually you can expect a response within 24 hours. <br> <br>

For telephone contact we can be reached from 09:30 to 17:00 on weekdays through +31 (0) 88 555 3 555. <br>
And if you leave a voicemail, we will call you back as soon as possible! <br> <br> <br>

 

<h3>Click, order and enjoy it</h3> <br>

With us, you can easily search for example taste profile, place of origin and - not completely insignificant - price. <br>
It is also possible to directly enter the article number or product name directly from the search bar. <br>
With our overview of packages, you have a wide choice of all kinds of composite products for you to taste. <br> <br>

For each purchased product you will receive an information sheet. <br>
For example, you can read more about your country of origin and get a lot of tips. <br> <br>

Of course you can also contact our service team with a question about the stock or advice. <br> <br>

Sincerely, <br>
Olaf Smid<br><br>
